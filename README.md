# Algorithms with Git

This is just a simple collection of algorithms in various languages. Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file before contributing.

Feel free to contribute any algorithm you can find! :smile:

Open an issue if you discover any bugs or issues with any algorithm or any documentation.

Happy Open Sourcing!
